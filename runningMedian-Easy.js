/*Was asked by Microsoft.
Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. 
Given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.
The median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.
For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out:
2
1.5
2
3.5
2
2
2

function runningMedian(args) {
    console.log(args[0]);
    for (let i = 1; i < args.length; i++) {
        if (args[])
    }
}

runningMedian([2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5]);
