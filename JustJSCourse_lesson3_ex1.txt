let reaction = 'yikes';
reaction[0] = 'l';
console.log(reaction);

1. declare reaction.
2. assign value of string 'yikes' to it.
3. cast reaction as an array - that is - convert the string reaction to an object.
4. assign value of 'l' string to the 1st element of reaction array. 

=======
NONE OF THAT HAPPENED!!!! 
console.log(reaction);
