let reaction = 'yikes';
reaction[0] = 'l';
console.log(reaction);

1. declare reaction.
2. assign value of string 'yikes' to it.
3. cast reaction as an array - that is - convert the string reaction to an object.
4. assign value of 'l' string to the 1st element of reaction array.

NONE OF THAT HAPPENED!!!! 
console.log(reaction);
VM4246:3 yikes


EX2:
let pet = 'Narwhal';
pet = 'The Kraken';
console.log(pet); // ?
Like before, write down your thinking process in a few sentences. 
Don’t rush ahead. Pay close attention to how you’re thinking about 
each line, step by step. Does immutability of strings play a role here, 
and what role does it play?

output: 'The Kraken'

I already new that type cant change but content can b/c its a variable.
Immutability of strings does not play a role because we are changing it from
a string to a string.
