Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether two numbers from list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

LeetCode Given arr of ints, return indices of the two numbers 
such that they add up to a specific target.
Assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may NOT use the same element twice.
Ex: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1]. EX2: IN [3,3] 6 OUT [0,1]
